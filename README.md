# Final Project Details - Wellness Event Site

## Personal Goals for Final Project:
* I am interested in integration, so I would like to compose a site or application from code that the team writes
as well as including functionality from external sources.  Fitbit and Facebook integrations would demonstrate 
receiving / utilizing data and pushing data out to an external system.
* I am extremely interested in big data - spotting trends, finding answers analytics.  From my prior work in 
Medicaid I think we're missing out on answers just because we aren't analyzing the data that we already have.  
This could be shown or explored in a lot of ways but data for wellness events is a starting point.

## User user stories
* As a user, I want to create and update a profile on the site so I can participate in a fitness community.
* As a user, I want to register my activity tracker (fitbit, possibly apple watch? others?) on the site so that 
my activity is automatically tracked. (integration point)
* As a user, I want to choose to make elements of my profile public or private so I can control what others see
* As a user, I want to sign up for events and allow my activity tracker data to be included in the event data set
so that my data can be shared with the community.
* As a user, I want to see visualizations of specific events so I can see what happened during a particular event.
Something like a heat map of heartrates, or steps per day, or some way of showing biked miles. (big data)
* As a user, I want to see the data for multiple events so I can see how the community has done over time.  
I'm not sure what would make sense, I'm sure there are options. (big data)
* As a user, I want to push "brag" data to Facebook - participation, badges, etc - so my friends there can see
what I've done. (integration point)
* As a user, I want the option to compete against other users (based on events participation, max steps, 
active / day, etc) for inspiration to strive harder.

## Admin user stories
* As an admin, I want to CRUD events so I can maintain the site.
* As an admin, I want the ability to access de-identified data en masse for analytics. (big data) 
* As an admin, I want to be able to access individual gamification data to award prizes to inspire participation
and competition.

# Project Ideas

## Wellness Event Site
Site to support the functionality of events like "10k a Day" (the Liberty Mutual step counting challenge) but supporting events beyond steps / day.
* Admin capabilities to CRUD events
* User sign up and participation in events
* Aggregation of user data for events (5k, biking, etc)
* Some way to visualize data, like a heat map of heartrates for the event - visualizing large data sets
* Integration with activity tracker / site data (fitbit? something comparable for iPhone data? something for biking?)
* Integration with social media (push participation data to facebook)
* Gamification - accrue points based on participation

## Financial Planning Education
A tool to educate K-12 users on the impact of financial planning - early exposure to the modeling tools that 
typically are available through employment.  A user will select a career and enter investment info ("what percentage of your pay would you like to invest?"  "when would you like to start investing?") and the site will show returns based on salary and corporate match averages.
* Mock investment accounts, tied to actual market performance
* Based on data for salary averages, career, corporate match - build out as realistically as possible
* Sets up users for success by showing the power of early investment
* Branding establishes positive view of sponsoring company

## File a Claim with Amazon Echo!
Who wouldn't enjoy filing a home or auto claim with Alexa walking you through an IVR menu?
* Potential for frequent use
* Could be used in vehicles, since [Ford](https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/4/14173324/ford-amazon-echo-alexa-integration-ces-2017) is already planning to offer Alexa on Board
* Report on or check status of the claim
* Integrate with Broker / Agent voicemail using mobile phone integration / facetime (for Echo Show)
* Comes with a branded cup-holder sized for the Echo Dot to establish a positive view of sponsoring company

## R-P-G-o-R-A-M-A
An integrated site to support the Pathfinder role-playing game system.  The tools exist, the site would integrate them and add data storage and display capabilities.
* Character creation - integrate with pcgen tool?
* Character repository - store chars, access for games, track progress, public / private options
* Gaming gamification - scores & ranking by user
* Online gaming - integrate with something like d20Pro for an online tabletop experience
* Discussion boards to facilitate flamewars
