# Project-Ideas

## Wellness Event Site
Site to support the functionality of events like "10k a Day" (the Liberty Mutual step counting challenge) but supporting events beyond steps / day.
* Admin capabilities to CRUD events
* User sign up and participation in events
* Aggregation of user data for events (5k, biking, etc)
* Some way to visualize data, like a heat map of heartrates for the event - visualizing large data sets
* Integration with activity tracker / site data (fitbit? something comparable for iPhone data? something for biking?)
* Integration with social media (push participation data to facebook)
* Gamification - accrue points based on participation

## Financial Planning Education
A tool to educate K-12 users on the impact of financial planning - early exposure to the modeling tools that 
typically are available through employment.  A user will select a career and enter investment info ("what percentage of your pay would you like to invest?"  "when would you like to start investing?") and the site will show returns based on salary and corporate match averages.
* Mock investment accounts, tied to actual market performance
* Based on data for salary averages, career, corporate match - build out as realistically as possible
* Sets up users for success by showing the power of early investment
* Branding establishes positive view of sponsoring company

## R-P-G-o-R-A-M-A
An integrated site to support the Pathfinder role-playing game system.
* Character creation - integrate with pcgen tool?
* Character repository - store chars, access for games, track progress, public / private options
* Gaming gamification - scores & ranking by user
* Online gaming - integrate with something like d20Pro for an online tabletop experience
* Discussion boards to facilitate flamewars
